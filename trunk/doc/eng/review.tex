The film which is for me the best of those studied was The Grapes of Wrath. Althought it was a little depressing, this film made me known a little more about the Great Depression in America. I didn't know too much about the Great Depression but thanks to this film i was able to see how it was terrible for some american families. To sum up, a family is forced off of their land and replace them by machines. Then the family has to travel to California to try to find some jobs in order to survive. The Grapes of Wrath shows us how human dignity is hard to keep when a family have to survive against adversity of american society and the law of market. Finally, this film was the one i prefered because John Ford shows us a very touching point of view of the Great Depression.

In my opinion, amongst the four movies we had to watch, American Friend is the one that needs the longest time to fix the action of the story but that doesn't avoid that movie to be the most interesting. To sum up the story, a picture framer suffering from a serious blood disease is manipulated and committed as a murderer in a mafia context, he accepts this job because he thinks that he will die soon so the money is a way for him to help his wife and son after his death. In fact, it is the one I preferred because its plot is very subtle and also because it deals with social aspects of money, such as manipulation, lies and murder. Moreover, the end of movie is quite surprising because the protagonist finally gets to die, that brings out reflections about fate and destiny.
