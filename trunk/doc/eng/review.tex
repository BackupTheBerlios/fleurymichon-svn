In my opinion, amongst the four movies we had to watch, American Friend is the one that needs the longest time to fix the action of the story but that doesn't avoid that movie to be the most interesting. To sum up the story, a picture framer suffering from a serious blood disease is manipulated and committed as a murderer in a mafia context, he accepts this job because he thinks that he will die soon so the money is a way for him to help his wife and son after his death. In fact, it is the one I preferred because its plot is very subtle and also because it deals with social aspects of money, such as manipulation, lies and murder. Moreover, the end of movie is quite surprising because the protagonist finally gets to die, that brings out reflections about fate and destiny.
