\subsection[Money on TV]{Money on TV\footnote{MTV?}}

Within the last decade, various entertainment TV shows appeared and became very popular. Some of these shows such as Jackass 
or Dirty Sanchez work on a very simple concept : the animators are paid to do unusual and stupid things, that makes the show 
funny and attractive for teenagers, the age class that is the most interested in this kind of programs.

\section{Money influence on the settle of identity}

\subsection{About materialism and property}

Money is something important in current social communities. It has been invented to define a standard of value that makes 
trading possible and easy between any amount of commodities. However, money is not omnipotent so materialism is not able to 
solve any problem, for example if someone you rely on gets to die, money and property won't fill the blank left by such a 
disappearance. A study established in Claremont Graduate University, California showed that trust is statistically more 
efficient than competition and individualism. That study confirms Aristotle's thesis saying that man is a social animal. 
Moreover, the young children's idealistic speech that rejects money value system usually does not last very long because 
they get to become aware how non-materialism does draw them aside of their peers. That idea is reinforced by the fact that 
for most citizens who say that they have grown up, adventure and dreams have been replaced by conservatism and conformity.
